# Agent-Based Financial Economics

This repository hosts all the contents of the course [Agent-Based Financial Economics, Autumn 2018 edition](https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/index.html#/modules/list/2017/003/50773378-50772427/details/SM/50857786").

There are a number of sister repositories, one for each team of students. These are named 'team000', 'team001', etc. You cannot see them because they are private and only accessible to the students who own them.

However, you can see how the agents of the other students perform by visiting the simulation page of the current exercise.

The exercises can be found in the [exercises folder](exercises/journal).

You can find more information about how to setup and use git repositories [here](http://meissereconomics.com/course/setup).
